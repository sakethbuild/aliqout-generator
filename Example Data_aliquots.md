1: Presenting Situation & Symptom Narrative
A 79-year-old female with a history of hypertension, T2DM, and significant CNS history (SAH, strokes, VP shunt) presents for follow-up.

The patient has been having *intermittent* episodes of 'slurring and drooling' and confusion. Her family is concerned. She also reports feeling 'slow' when walking and has some ataxia.

She denies any falls, lightheadedness, or dizziness. The symptoms seem to come and go without a clear pattern initially.

2: Relevant Baseline Context
Past Medical History:
- T2DM, HTN, CKD IIIa
- SAH (2021) s/p coiling/shunt, complicated by multiple strokes.
- **Dementia/Confusion**: History of not taking medications due to confusion.

Medications:
- Losartan, HCTZ, Amlodipine
- Metformin
- Omeprazole

Social History / Further History:
Upon further questioning about the timing of these episodes, the family brings up a specific concern. They have noticed she often gets confused **after eating bananas**. They report she has been hiding and eating them, and they correlate this behavior with her slurring and confusion.

3: Physical Exam
General: Alert, accompanied by daughter.
Neuro: Ataxia noted. Family reports left foot drop (not seen on exam). No acute slurring/drooling in clinic today.

4: Initial Objective Data: Labs, Imaging, Studies
Vitals: BP 150/57. HR, Temp not recorded.

Labs:
- Sodium: 141 mmol/L
- Potassium: 3.8 mmol/L (Normal)
- Glucose: 134 mg/dL (High)
- Creatinine: 1.07 mg/dL

Imaging (CT Head): Unremarkable for acute abnormalities. Shunt intact.

8: Diagnostic Synthesis / Working Diagnosis
**Diagnosis:** Intermittent Confusion/Symptoms likely related to Dietary Exposure (Bananas) vs Dysphagia in setting of Dementia

**Explanation:** The key teaching point is to **listen to the family's observation of exposures**. While hyperkalemia from bananas was a consideration, the normal K+ makes it unlikely. However, the *behavior* (hiding food, dementia) and the *timing* (post-prandial symptoms) point towards a specific trigger. The 'slurring/drooling' might actually be dysphagia/aspiration episodes triggered by the texture of the bananas or 'pocketing' food due to dementia, rather than metabolic encephalopathy.
