Based on the provided EMR notes, here is the structured clinical reasoning reconstruction.

**1: Presenting Situation & Symptom Narrative**
*   **Patient:** 22-year-old male.
*   **Setting:** Serial presentation to Urgent Care, then ED (1/22/25), then Clinic (1/23/25).
*   **Chief Complaint:** Right leg swelling, pain, and "hot to touch" sensation.
*   **Timeline:**
    *   **2 weeks prior:** Mechanical fall (slid off couch onto buttocks/knee).
    *   **2 days prior to presentation:** Acute worsening of symptoms. Noticed R knee/thigh became "completely swollen" while putting on boots.
*   **Symptom Characteristics:**
    *   Pain described as "tingling, burning, severe nerve pain" (10/10) radiating from low back to hip/leg.
    *   Reported subjective fever (but afebrile on exams).
*   **Surrogate History:** Mother corroborated timeline in phone follow-up.

**2: Relevant Baseline Context**
*   **Medical History:**
    *   Paraplegia (T9 level) secondary to GSW (2021).
    *   Neurogenic bladder (requires self-catheterization) and bowel.
    *   Severe muscle spasticity.
    *   Depression/Anxiety.
*   **Social/Behavioral:**
    *   **Key Behavioral Mechanism:** Patient admits to repeatedly **punching his own thigh** to resolve muscle spasms.
    *   Sexual History: Unprotected sexual activity ~1 week prior to symptom onset (concern for GC).
    *   Substance Use: Daily marijuana use.
*   **Medications:** Baclofen (noted to be expired/ran out around time of presentation), Oxybutynin.

**3: Physical Exam (Composite of Clinic Visits)**
*   **General:** No acute distress, though reports pain with spasms. Cachectic/malnourished appearance.
*   **Musculoskeletal (Right Leg):**
    *   Generalized edema of right thigh and knee.
    *   Fullness/firmness of the quadriceps.
    *   Mild warmth noted; small area of erythema.
    *   **Ecchymosis:** Scant ecchymosis at R inguinal area/medial proximal thigh (initially attributed to prior US probe pressure vs. trauma).
    *   Compartments soft/compressible despite fullness.
*   **Neurologic:** Paraplegic T9-down (motor/sensory deficits).
*   **POCUS (Point of Care Ultrasound) in Clinic:** No evidence of significant intra-articular effusion in the suprapatellar recess.

**4: Initial Objective Data (ED & Early Clinic)**
*   **Ultrasound R Lower Extremity (1/22/25):** Negative for DVT.
*   **X-Ray R Knee/Femur (1/23/25):** Small suprapatellar soft tissue effusion; soft tissue swelling. No acute fracture or dislocation.
*   **Labs (1/23/25):**
    *   CBC: Normal white count (WNL).
    *   Inflammatory Markers: CRP "isolated high."
    *   Syphilis screen: Negative.
    *   Urine Drug Screen: Negative.

**5: Clinical Course & Interim Evolution**
*   **Intervention:** Patient received an IV steroid injection at the initial Urgent Care/ED visit.
*   **Trend (1/23 to 1/29):**
    *   Swelling and pain began to decrease/improve spontaneously.
    *   Patient reported new "brown/cloudy urine" with foul odor (suggesting concomitant UTI).
*   **Decision Making:**
    *   Initial concern was high for Septic Arthritis (Gonococcal) given sexual history and warmth.
    *   However, clinical improvement without antibiotics and negative joint POCUS lowered suspicion.
    *   Plan shifted to "watch and wait" for CT imaging to differentiate deep infection vs. trauma.

**6: Diagnostic Imaging (CT)**
*   **CT Right Lower Extremity w/ Contrast (1/29/25):**
    *   **Findings:** Nonspecific curvilinear peripherally enhancing fluid collection in the deep anterior compartment (vastus intermedius).
    *   **Dimensions:** 3-4 cm AP x 20 cm Craniocaudal (long/large collection).
    *   **Interpretation:** Favored to represent **hematoma** over abscess.
    *   **Negatives:** No septic joint effusion, no osteomyelitis.

**7: Diagnostic Synthesis & Outcome**
*   **Working Diagnosis:** **Traumatic Deep Thigh Hematoma.**
*   **Reasoning:**
    *   *Mechanism:* Likely multifactorial combination of the fall (2 weeks prior) and the patient's history of **punching his spastic quadriceps**, exacerbated by presumed fragility of paralyzed tissue.
    *   *Rule-out:* Septic arthritis effectively ruled out by CT (extra-articular fluid) and spontaneous clinical improvement without antibiotics. DVT ruled out by US.
    *   *Confounds:* Elevated CRP likely reactive to hematoma or concurrent UTI (cloudy urine). "Nerve pain" likely compressive neuropathy from the deep hematoma or baseline spinal pathology.
*   **Outcome:**
    *   Hematoma noted to be resolving/absorbed on follow-up.
    *   Pain management adjusted (Gabapentin increased).
    *   Treated for concurrent UTI.
