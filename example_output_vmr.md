# Case: 61F with Painful Mouth Sores and "Blisters"

## 1: Presenting Situation & Symptom Narrative
A 61-year-old female presents to the outpatient clinic with a chief complaint of painful mouth sores, sinus pain, and bad breath, present for one month.

She reports visualizing "blisters" on her tongue, though she notes none are present today. She denies prior episodes, genital sores, or rashes elsewhere. She denies recent sexual activity.

She saw a dentist one month ago who did not mention oral symptoms, though she reports being symptomatic at that time. She does not wear dentures.

## 5: Diagnostic Synthesis / Working Diagnosis
**Diagnosis:** Burning Mouth Syndrome (BMS)

**Explanation:**
The patient presents with chronic oral pain and a sensation of "blisters," yet the physical exam is completely normal with no visible lesions. This dissociation—**symptoms without signs**—is the hallmark of Burning Mouth Syndrome (BMS), especially in post-menopausal women.

The diagnostic reasoning focused on ruling out secondary causes ("burning mouth symptoms" vs. primary syndrome):
*   **Nutritional:** B12, folate, zinc, and B6 were normal. Iron saturation was low (13%), which can contribute to mucosal pain, though ferritin was not frankly low.
*   **Endocrine:** TSH was low (0.18), likely due to over-replacement of levothyroxine, but this does not typically cause oral burning. Diabetes was excluded (A1c 6.2%).
*   **Local/Infectious:** No thrush, lichen planus, or herpes was seen.

Given the negative workup for systemic causes and the normal exam, the diagnosis of primary BMS is made. Management involves neuropathic pain modulators (e.g., gabapentin, which was started) and supportive care.
